the one more use case of the static keyword is that . when we are
creating the Main class and inside the Main we are creating 
object class where we are not putting static keyword then we
have to create Main class object then after we can create the object
for the inner class in the main function class . therefore
we use the static keyword that we can directly use at the compile
time.


cause of this method/ use of the static  are inserting the values 
at the compile time .

special thing about the toString() method ?

ans-when we have to return the child object and without accessing the 
child of the parent class we can do this.
and it is used for multiple purposes to convert the integer
into string.
